## Environment Variables

To run the NASA Asteroid project, you need to set up the following environment variables:

- `NASA_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API.
- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL or connection string for the database used by the project.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for session management and security purposes.

You can set these environment variables in different ways depending on your environment:

### Local Development
For local development, you can create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and store the environment variables there. Here's an example of how your `.env` file might look:

NASA_API_KEY=your-api-key

DATABASE_URL=your-database-url

SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key


### Production Deployment
For production deployments, you should set the environment variables according to your hosting provider's guidelines. This may involve using environment variable settings in your hosting dashboard or server configuration files.

Remember to keep your API keys and secret keys secure and never hardcode them directly into your codebase.
