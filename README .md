## Introduction

In real estate, predicting the price of a home accurately is crucial for both buyers and sellers. This project leverages Machine Learning to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a house based on several features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of houses along with their corresponding prices. It includes features such as:

- Area
- Number of bedrooms
- Location
- Age of the house
- Amenities
- and more...

The dataset is available in the `data` directory.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


    git clone
    
     https://github.com/RAJESHVHANKADE/House_Value_Prediction/tree/main
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd home-value-prediction


3. Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Explore the dataset by opening and running the Jupyter Notebook Explore_Data.ipynb.

2. Preprocess the data and train the model by running Train_Model.ipynb.

3. Predict the prices of homes using the trained model by running Predict_Prices.ipynb.

4. You can also use the trained model in your own Python script by importing it:


from model import HomeValuePredictor

##Load the model

model = HomeValuePredictor.load_model('path/to/model')

##Use the model to predict prices

predicted_prices = model.predict(X_test)
